    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Robert';

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // If you update an array it will go back to the reference and update the original

    // However what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // Calling an empty slice() will make a copy of the original array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // Another way to make a copy of the original array

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    console.clear();

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
        name: 'Rick Sanchez',
        age: 75
    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captian = person;
    // captian.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 13});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const rick = {
        name: 'Rick',
        age: 63,
        number: 13,
        social: {
            twitter: '@shwifty',
            facebook: 'N/A'
        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(rick);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, rick);

    // When using Object.assign it only goes one level deep - so changing the dev social object will impact rick
    // to go more than one level you can use deepClone()

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(rick));

    console.clear();


    // This will go deep by passing JSON.stringify() an object which returns a string and then immediately use JSON.parse()
    // to turn it back into an object which gives you a copy without impacting the original - poor mans deep clone
